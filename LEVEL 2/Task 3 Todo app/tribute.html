                Narendra Modi served as the Prime Minister of India. He was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat. Narendra Modi is a prominent Indian politician who rose to prominence within the ranks of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and became the 14th Prime Minister of India in May 2014. <br>
                <br>
Modi's political career began in the early 1980s, and he held various positions within the BJP and the Gujarat government. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, he was known for his development-oriented policies and his role in bringing economic growth to the state.<br>
<br>
As Prime Minister, Modi's leadership style was marked by his charisma, strong communication skills, and an emphasis on economic reforms and development. His government launched several initiatives, such as "Make in India," "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" (Clean India Campaign), "Digital India," and "Skill India," aiming to boost economic growth, modernize the country, and address various social issues.<br>
<br>
However, Modi's tenure was also marked by controversies and criticisms, particularly regarding issues like religious and social harmony, freedom of expression, and concerns over rising intolerance. His government's economic policies also faced mixed reviews from experts and citizens.<br>
